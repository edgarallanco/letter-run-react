# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This application is developed using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`
This will create a file called bundle.js which you can use with webflow. To use the script,
create a div in Webflow with id **"react-target"**. All the resources needed for the app is
included in this repository and also avaialable for download in AWS S3.

## Running Locally
You can use the **"animation"** branch to work with react and three.js locally.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
